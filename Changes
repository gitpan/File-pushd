Revision history for Perl module File::pushd

1.00 Tue Sep 25 08:19:30 EDT 2007
    - changed to the Apache License, version 2.0; (it's clearer, relicensable,
      and is explicit about contributions)
    - moved pod/coverage tests to xt/ 
    - preserve() will preserve a temporary directory beyond the program end
      (by design rather than due to bug RT#21953 in File::Temp); added 
      tests to confirm this behavior after File::Temp is fixed
