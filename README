NAME
    File::pushd - temporary chdir until File::pushd object goes out of scope

SYNOPSIS
     use File::pushd;

     chdir $ENV{HOME};
     {
         my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' );
         # working directory changed to /tmp
     }
     # working directory reverted to $ENV{HOME}

DESCRIPTION
    File::pushd does a temporary `chdir' that is easily and automatically
    reverted. It works by creating a simple object that caches the original
    working directory. When the object is destroyed, the destructor calls
    `chdir' to revert to the working directory at the time the object was
    created.

USAGE
     use File::pushd;

    Using File::pushd automatically imports the `pushd' function.

    File::pushd also overloads stringification so that objects created with
    `pushd' stringify as the absolute filepath that was set when the object
    was created.

  pushd

     $dir = pushd( $target_directory);

    Caches the current working directory, changes the working directory to
    the target directory, and returns a File::pushd object. When the object
    is destroyed, the working directory is reverted to the original
    directory.

  as_string

     print "$dir"; # calls $dir->as_string()

    Returns the absolute path of the working directory set by the pushd
    object. Used automatically when the object is stringified.
